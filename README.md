# JavaScript-Quiz

## Description
The JavaScript Code Quiz has 8 multiple-choice questions. The user has a certain amount of time to complete the quiz. Upon completion, the user will see their score and can add it to the Leaderboard.

It was a fun and challenging project. I was able to use my creativity to create a fun quiz. The challenging part was creating the code for specific elements I wanted the quiz to have. Overall, I learned from my errors, and feel thankful for the help I got from our teacher.
